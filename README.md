# Map Demos (mostly with WNV data)


Several map demos to provide examples for obtaining data, plotting points, plotting polygons, and calculating and plotting heat maps.  Many of these examples were developed while working on the West Nile Virus prediction model, but these examples are general and draw from other work as well. 

My personal library `geneorama` has functions that automatically install library dependencies within R. To install `geneorama` execute the code in `00_Setup.R`


Please visit https://gitter.im/wnv_map_demo/General to ask questions about the project.
